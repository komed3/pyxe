## What is this?

**`pyxe`** will become a modular and lightweight color computation framework built in TypeScript.

It aims to support:

- Color space conversions (RGB, LAB, LCH, HSL, XYZ, etc.)
- Color transformations (hue shift, lighten/darken, interpolation)
- Named color libraries (RAL, CSS, custom sets)
- Flexible parsing and comparison mechanisms

All features will be split into submodules, so you only install what you really need.

## Why the name?

Because when it comes to color, every little **pyxe(l)** counts.  
(Also: _pyxe_ sounds like _pigments_, and it's short, unique, and available ðŸ˜Ž)

## Stay tuned!

The actual implementation is coming soon. This is just the primer coat.
