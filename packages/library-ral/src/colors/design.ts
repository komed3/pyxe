/**
 * RAL Design
 * 
 * The RAL Design System is a scientifically structured palette based on the
 * CIELab color space. Unlike the Classic and Effect collections, it is not
 * organized around practical or industrial conventions, but rather follows
 * perceptual uniformity principles to provide evenly distributed, systematic
 * color choices.
 * 
 * Ideal for architects, interior designers, and creative professionals, the
 * Design system allows for precise control over hue, lightness, and chroma.
 * Its naming convention reflects this (e.g. RAL 270 30 25), and it includes
 * over 1,800 colors.
